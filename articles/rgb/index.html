<p><span class="more"><span></p>
<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The Seven Day Roguelike challenge (<a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Seven_Day_Roguelike_Challenge"><span class="caps">7DRL</span></a>) has been an annual competition since around 2005. The premise is simple: create a roguelike game in seven&nbsp;days! </p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">wikipedia</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roguelike is a subgenre of role-playing video games characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated game levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the&nbsp;player-character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, like many developers before me, have a long history of half-started games stretching back to middle school (our half-finished Pokemon clone on the <span class="caps">TI</span>-83+ was legendary) so the concept of actually finishing something was very appealing to me. I teamed up with a friend and we were&nbsp;off!</p>
<p><img src="/articles/rgb/rgb.png" alt="RGB">
<em>Gotta love those&nbsp;rats</em></p>
<p>Our idea was somewhat simple: create a simple dungeon crawler in which you could shift between three dimensions (red, green, blue - hence the name of the game). Initially we were thinking you could gain experience in a dimension for staying in it longer but in the end we made it so that each dimension had its own “special&nbsp;move”.</p>
<p><img src="/articles/rgb/green.png" alt="red">
<em>Our helpful hint to switch&nbsp;dimensions</em></p>
<p>It’s not the most beautiful or robust (there is a still a bug when going to the next level that I haven’t figured out yet) game in the world, but we made it in seven days! From scratch. Take a <a href="http://bovard.github.io/rgb/">crack at it now</a>! If you get to level 10, consider yourself an <span class="caps">RGB</span>&nbsp;champion.</p>
<p><img src="/articles/rgb/green2.png" alt="green">
<em>You’re&nbsp;green!</em></p>
<h4 id="code">Code</h4>
<p><span class="caps">RGB</span> is played in your browser and uses a combination of html element and canvas to render. We wrote everything from scratch, including the game engine, which was quite the learning experience. You can view the code <a href="https://github.com/bovard/rgb">on github</a>.</p>
<p>The encapsulation wasn’t the best, <a href="https://github.com/bovard/rgb/blob/master/src/Game.js">Game.js</a> touches rendering, creep ai, input, game logic, and display but I think it was pretty decent for seven days of&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of the most gnarly code came when we implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra’s algorithm</a> to help our creeps move a little more intelligently. You can see our very simplistic creep ai&nbsp;here:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">    takeCreepTurn: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">creepController, dijk, closeQuartersDijk</span>) </span>{
        <span class="comment">// attack logic if we are in this dimension</span>
        <span class="keyword">if</span> (creepController.isAdjacentToHero()) {
            creepController.attackHero();
        } <span class="keyword">else</span> <span class="keyword">if</span>(creepController.aggroHero()) {
            <span class="comment">// Prioritize closeQuartersDijk if it has information</span>
            <span class="keyword">var</span> next = closeQuartersDijk.getNextTile(creepController.getCharacter().getLocation());
            <span class="keyword">if</span> (!next) {
                next = dijk.getNextTile(creepController.getCharacter().getLocation());
                <span class="keyword">if</span> (next)
                    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">"Dikj is telling me to go to"</span>, next.toString(), <span class="string">'from'</span>, creepController.getCharacter().getLocation().toString());
            }
            <span class="keyword">else</span> {
                <span class="keyword">if</span> (next)
                    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">"closeQtrDikj is telling me to go to"</span>, next.toString(), <span class="string">'from'</span>, creepController.getCharacter().getLocation().toString());
            }
            <span class="keyword">if</span> (next) {
                <span class="keyword">var</span> dir = creepController.getCharacter().getLocation().directionTo(next);
                <span class="keyword">if</span> (creepController.canMove(dir)) {
                    creepController.move(dir);
                } <span class="keyword">else</span> {
                    <span class="comment">// Dijkstra should never tell the creep to move where it can't <span class="caps">BUT</span> just in case it does</span>
                    <span class="keyword">this</span>.doBestAdjacentMove(creepController);
                }
            } <span class="keyword">else</span> {
                <span class="keyword">this</span>.doBestAdjacentMove(creepController);
            }
        }
</code></pre>
<p>You can see we borrowed heavily from <a href="http://www.battlecode.org/">battlecode’s api</a> with <code>creepController</code> and <code>canMove</code>. Had I actually made a <code>creepPlayer</code> things might have been much cleaner (and different creeps could have different ai /&nbsp;behaviors).</p>
<h4 id="results">Results</h4>
<p><span class="caps">RGB</span> was a success (by 7DRL standards)! We were even featured as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/216bwe/7drl_of_the_day_day_7_rgb/"><span class="caps">7DRL</span> of the Day</a> on reddit and was reviewed a couple times in the <a href="http://7drl.roguetemple.com/Reviews"><span class="caps">7DRL</span> Reviews</a> (thanks to Jabberwock and Yeti for taking the time!) and given an overall score of 2.2 (out of&nbsp;3)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<span class="caps">RGB</span> is a browser roguelike with an interesting multi-dimensional mechanic. Red Green and Blue all operate as separate dimensions of the same dungeon. After the first three levels, where switching is mostly useless and/or instant death, the mechanic becomes very interesting! You can only attach enemies in your same dimension, but you can use other dimensions to escape. The level colors are a bit over-bearing but the dimension switching is cool!” -&nbsp;Yeti</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the years <span class="caps">RGB</span> has seen surprisingly more play than I expected. I’m not sure who was playing everyday in the summer of 2015, but whoever you are, I salute you! We’ve had players from 48 states (North Dakota and Alaska, looking at you) and on average people give up after just over a&nbsp;minute.</p>
<p><img src="/articles/rgb/analytics.png" alt="Analytics"></p>
<p>Overall it felt great to actually finish a game, and I hope I’ll be participating in the <span class="caps">7DRL</span> in the&nbsp;future!</p>
